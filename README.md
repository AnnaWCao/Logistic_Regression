# Logistic_Regression

This is my data analysis pipeline for my latest research project studying conceptual compositionality in children. In my main analysis, I used a mixed-effect logistic regression test to assess children's performance in 6 critical test trials. Each test trial had a 0 / 1 binary outcome (success or failure), and I predicted children's likelihood to succeed in a trial based on factors including age category and gender.
